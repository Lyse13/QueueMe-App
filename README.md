# QueueMe-App
QueueMe is a virtual queuing system for students and customers needing to visit crowded university, offices, such as registration,  banks, restaurants or healthcare . Instead of standing in line, people reserve a virtual spot and get notified when itâ€™s their turn. This project was developed as a final project for the Software Architecture course.
